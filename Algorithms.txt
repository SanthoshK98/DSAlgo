How to represent complexity
Asymptotic notations

- Mathematical tools to represent time and space complexity
 Big-O Notation(O-notation) - Worst case Complexity
 Omega Notation - Best case Complexity
 Theta Notation - Average case Complexity


4.Big O Notation

The worst case complexity of an algorithm is represented using the Big-O notation
Big O notation describes the complexity of an algorithm using algebraic terms

It has two important characteristics
 it is expressed in terms of the input
 it focuses on the bigger picture without getting caught up in the minute details

Time Complexity

O(n) - Linear => size of input increases time complexity increases
O(1) - Constant => irrespective of size code executes once
O(n square) - two nested loops then it is quadratic
O(n cubic) - morethan two nested loop then it is cubic
O(logn) - Logarithmic => input size reduces by half every iteration

Space Complexity

O(1) - Constant => memory needed does not depend on the input size
O(n) - Linear => memory increases when size of input increases
O(logn) - Logarithmic
